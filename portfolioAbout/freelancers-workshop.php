<p>I wanted to build freelancers workshop to help those that have just learned to code, turn that new skill into some money. I freelanced for many years and learned a lot over that time period. This is my way of giving back to the community.</p>

<p>This is a work in progress. I'm not sure when things will be officially launched. Right now, I have a simple landing page up to capture the email addresses of folks that are interested.</p>
