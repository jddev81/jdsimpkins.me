<p>When I first started at DCS Marketing, they didn't have a smooth way to keep track of invoicing. (When to invoice, when one was paid, etc.) I decided to build a system that would make this smoother and keep everyone on the same page.</p>

<p>I put together this web application to log all current clients, what services were performed each month, what day they are billed on, the amount, etc. </p>

<p>When an invoice is due, all admin users of the system that have elected to receive emails will get an email letting them know to send it out.</p>

<p>Invoice is then sent out and logged in the system. Once payment is made, it is logged in the system.</p>

<p>It worked so well, they decided to include two other departments in this as well, (IT and Security) so they work the same way as above but are just contained in their own department.</p>
