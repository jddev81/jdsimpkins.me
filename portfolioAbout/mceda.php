<p>Mason County Economic Development Authority presented me with a very outdated website and one they couldn't really manage their available properties on.</p>

<p>They wanted a fresh website that added more details about the area and the biggest part of the project was a way for them to manage the properties available for development in Mason County.</p>

<p>I built the main site on WordPress and elected to build the property management section with vanilla PHP. I separated this from the site and hosted it on a subdomain.</p>

<p>Not only are folks able to browse the available properties, "save" or "favorite" them for later reference, and request info on a particular property, but the admins have a back end they can log into and manage the properties as well. This is all a custom CMS.</p>

<p>They can remove properties, add properties, make them "featured" (which moves them to the top of the list and let's the visitor know it is a featured property), and add/edit/delete any info about a particular property.</p>

<p>I worked a lot with the Google Maps API and learned a great deal about it with this project. Their plan for the future is to have me build a more in depth GIS for them.</p>
